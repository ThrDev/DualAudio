DualAudio (C) 2013 Thr
=======

Allows you to output audio to two outputs instead of Windows' limit of one output.

Instructions:
First, you'll need to install Virtual Audio Cable:

Virtual Audio cable comes with a program called "Audio Repeater". This audio repeater constantly says "Trial" every 5 seconds, and it really interrupts your music or anything in general. I decided I would make a copy of this without all of the hassle.
Once you have Virtual Audio cable installed, you'll need to go to your Audio Settings and set your Default output device to Line 1 (Virtual Audio Cable).
After you do so, run dualaudio.exe and then it will show up, you select the number of your audio input device (in this case, Line 1), then you select your audio output devices (Should be like Speakers and HDMI output or something of the sort). After this, just press enter and it will start playback. Now you have a working dual audio output (:
